## 09-website-notify-handler.yml
- notify is used inside a task.
- It tells Ansible to trigger a handler if the task results in a change.
- Here, notify: restart apache means if the httpd package was changed (e.g., newly installed), Ansible will trigger the handler named "restart apache".
- handler is a special type of task that runs only when notified.
- Usually used for services that should be restarted/reloaded only if something changed (like config file updates, package installations).
